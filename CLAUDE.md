# CLAUDE.md — Operating manual for AI agents

> **Moved:** this knowledge base now lives in [`plus-jan/cscoach`](https://github.com/plus-jan/cscoach)
> (a fork of autoresearch, ADR-0007). This repository will be archived; do not work here.

This repository is the **knowledge base** for **cscoach**: a data-driven coaching engine for amateur and
semi-pro Counter-Strike 2 players. It holds the concepts an agent needs to build, validate and extend the
system: goals, specs, data description, assumptions, roadmap, research.
The project repository is a **fork of `uditgoenka/autoresearch`** (ADR-0007, supersedes ADR-0004). It
contains the autoresearch loop tooling, this knowledge base and, later, the implementation (`src/cscoach/`).
Until the fork exists (task M0.6), this repository is the knowledge base only. Either way the knowledge
base is the source of truth: agents that implement report results back here.

The engine turns **PureSkill.gg CSDS match data** into calibrated **Win Probability (WP)**, **Win
Probability Added (WPA)**, **Expected Kills (xK)**, economy and spatial metrics, and then into
**counterfactual, actionable coaching feedback**.

The overriding goal is **accuracy you can prove**. A metric that is not calibrated, validated on held-out
*matches*, and backed by verified assumptions must never reach a player.

## How to work

0. **The route is a hypothesis; the rules are not** (ADR-0006). The pipeline in docs/specs/01 is the
   current best guess. Results decide the next step. Only tasks in ROADMAP **Part A** are committed.
1. **Pick a task** from ROADMAP Part A: the first open one whose dependencies are done (skill
   `next-task`). Never start Part C items directly. When a decision point's inputs are complete, or Part
   A runs out, run `plan-next-step` and get the user's approval for the next batch.
2. **Read before acting:** the spec sections the task names; the `[paper_id]` notes it cites
   (`docs/research/papers/<id>.md`); the assumptions `[A-NN]` it touches (`docs/assumptions.yaml`).
3. **Data only from CSDS** via `pureskillgg-dsdk` / `pureskillgg-csgo-dsdk` (`docs/data/README.md`).
   New features must be computable from CSDS channels. No demo parsing, no external datasets.
4. **Implement in the project repository** (the fork, ADR-0007), test-first, following the specs and the
   reference algorithms in `docs/specs/04_validation_protocol.md`. Every run writes a reproducible
   report (see "Evidence"). Autoresearch loops are allowed only as `docs/specs/07` says: gated keep
   rule, training matches only, sealed test evaluated once, bounded budget. Output of persona commands
   (`predict`, `reason`, `probe`, `improve`, `scenario`, `learn`) is ideation, never evidence.
5. **Report back here, in the same change set:** tick the task in `ROADMAP.md`, add a line to
   `docs/PROGRESS.md`, update `docs/assumptions.yaml` statuses with evidence, and update specs/ADRs if
   behaviour or decisions changed. Results that change beliefs or plans also get a **finding** in
   `docs/FINDINGS.md`, including null results.

## Non-negotiable accuracy rules

- **Split by match, never by row/tick/round.** Snapshots in a round share one outcome; rounds in a match
  share players. Add a **temporal split** by revision date / `header.build_num` for drift. (There is no
  cross-match player identity, so "player holdout" is replaced by match holdout. See ADR-0005.)
- **No future information in features.** A feature at tick *t* uses only data with tick ≤ *t*. Round
  outcome, final scores, `round_end` fields and later events are forbidden. Keep a denylist and test it.
- **Always compare to a baseline** with **cluster-bootstrap CIs over matches**.
- **Calibration is first-class:** Brier, log-loss, ECE (quantile bins), reliability curves *per tier,
  per map, per round phase, per platform*. Gates: `docs/specs/06_parameters.md`.
- **Honest uncertainty:** report effective sample size and use cluster-level resampling. Never use naive
  row-level standard errors.
- **Tier awareness:** don't apply a model fitted on one tier/platform to another without verified
  calibration (assumption A-01).
- **Player metrics are within-match:** shrink toward the tier prior, show intervals, and pass the
  within-match reliability checks before display.
- **Assumption gate:** no player-facing capability ships while an assumption that `blocks` it is `open`
  or `refuted` (`docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md`). Every threshold/constant must have an assumption ID in
  `docs/specs/06_parameters.md`. Add a register entry before introducing a new one.
- **Game constants are configuration**, never hard-coded, and are verified against CSDS
  (`player_status.money`, `tick`/`round_state` phases). Tag every match with `build_num`.
- **Never invent numbers in coaching text.** Only engine-computed values; never literature numbers.
- **Respect the data license** (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DSA): non-commercial, attribute "Data provided by
  PureSkill.gg.", share derived data alike, never attempt re-identification.

## Evidence

A claim counts as evidence only if it is reproducible. The report must contain the code-repo commit, the
config hash, the CSDS revision ids and date range, the channel-set version, the counts (matches, rounds,
rows), the ESS, metrics with CIs, and gate verdicts. Store reports in the project repo
(`reports/experiments/<timestamp>_<name>/`) and link them from `docs/PROGRESS.md` / `docs/assumptions.yaml`.
A loop's own metric is not evidence. Its report adds the loop budget, CI level, number of variants
tried, seeds and the TSV ledger, and only the single sealed-test evaluation afterwards counts
(docs/specs/07 §3, §6).
Results on synthetic data prove code correctness only, never facts about CS2 (A-33).

## Research references

Full-text papers: `docs/research/papers/<id>.md` (index and rules in its README). Consult them before
designing a model, feature, metric, validation step or feedback format. Cite by `sources.yaml` id as
`[id]`. Trust order: paper full text > its cscoach notes > `sources.yaml` > `research_synthesis_de.md`
(the synthesis has known errors). Only `verified: true` entries justify decisions; `verified: notes` (e.g. HLTV articles) may support conventions, not evidence. Missing full text →
list it in the papers README and ask the user for the PDF (skill `add-paper`).

## Conventions

- Perspective: probabilities are from the **CT side** unless suffixed `_t`; `wp_ct + wp_t = 1`; WPA is
  signed from the acting player's team perspective.
- Time: CSDS `second` (derived from `tick` and `header.tick_rate`); ticks as int; read the tick rate from
  the header, never assume it.
- Names: snake_case; derived-table columns as in `docs/specs/02_data_contracts.md`.
- Randomness: seeded. Every stochastic step records its seed.
- Checks: `python3 scripts/kbcheck.py` must exit 0 before committing (run it, then commit; never chain a
  commit after a check that may fail).

## When blocked

- No fork / no access to the project repository → ask the user to fork `uditgoenka/autoresearch` and
  grant access (M0.6); meanwhile work in the knowledge base.
- Missing CSDS access → ask the user (ADX subscription approval + AWS credentials). Meanwhile, build
  and test logic on synthetic data, and mark the task `[~]` with what still needs real data.
- An assumption turns out false → set it to `refuted` with evidence, stop dependent work, and propose the
  design change (ADR).
- Unverified research claim → don't use it as justification; request the paper.

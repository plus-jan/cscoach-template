# cscoach — CS2 coaching engine (knowledge base)

> **Moved:** this knowledge base now lives in [`plus-jan/cscoach`](https://github.com/plus-jan/cscoach)
> (a fork of autoresearch, ADR-0007). This repository will be archived; do not work here.

A knowledge base for AI agents building a **data-driven, statistically validated coaching engine** for
amateur and semi-pro Counter-Strike 2 players. It covers calibrated round **Win Probability**, **WPA**
credit, **Expected Kills (xK)**, and economy and spatial analytics, turned into counterfactual,
actionable feedback.

The project is being moved to a **fork of [autoresearch](https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch)**
(ADR-0007): the fork holds the loop tooling, this knowledge base and the implementation. Loops run only
under [`docs/specs/07_autoresearch_protocol.md`](docs/specs/07_autoresearch_protocol.md). Until the
fork exists (M0.6), this repository is the knowledge base. The only data source is the **PureSkill.gg
CSDS corpus**, used through the official `pureskillgg-dsdk` libraries (ADR-0003).
